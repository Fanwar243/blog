                <h2>Frontierlands: Act One</h2>
                <p>
                    Something stirred in the bushes. Kental could almost smell the beast who so foolishly preyed on him. 
                    He tightened his grip about his atlatl, and raised the weapon above his right shoulder, ready to strike. 
                    He set his gaze upon the dense overgrowth ahead, where the leaves had shook and fallen. 
                    He listened carefully for the sound of crunching foliage, the snapping of twigs, and the sudden changes in the stillness of the air.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    The panther sprang into the air from his left, maws of razor teeth agape and clawed legs outstretched. 
                    In one swift motion, Kental let loose the bronze-head dart from his atlatl, sending it clean through the mouth of the beast 
                    with a sickening crunch. The animal dropped dead to the leaf-strewn forest floor with a thud, barely inches from Kental’s feet. 
                    The cat gave a few final spasms, blood spurting and leaking from whence the spear had punctured it, before the last light faded 
                    from its eyes. 
                    Kental withdrew his dart from the carcass, and threw it away.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    Kental studied the beast. It was larger than the killer cats closer to home, but much more ferocious. 
                    This was the third panther Kental had slain in the past hour. This was not the first time that Kental had hunted this 
                    far into the woods, yet in all his past hunting trips the panthers had not been as many in these parts as now. 
                    Something must have been driving these creatures away from farther into the woods.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    Could it be the Tree-Eater? The stories seem to ring true the more Kental thought about the situation. 
                    The Tree-Eater’s presence had reached farther faster than anyone had thought, told the stories. 
                    The gobbler of woods, consuming land and laying waste to everything that lay and grew in it. It was a matter of time before the 
                    Tree-Eater would come to the city, and devour us all. 
                    Kental dismissed the stories for now. He needed to know what had been driving the animals away and making them become more hostile.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    Kental left the dead beasts for the other creatures to feast. 
                    He had had more skins than he needed by now.  He continued farther into the ancient woods.
