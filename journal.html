                <h2>Reading is Fundamental</h2>
                <p>
                    Here are 5 reasons why I believe reading to be a beneficial pastime.
                    First, books make you retain information better.
                    1. Reading is a skill that needs to be improved upon
                        1. Reading can be definitely hard, but it something that one can  and should get better at.
                        2. Most people seem to think that since they've learned how to read at school they don't need to spend any more effort in building it up further, in other words, it is something that once acquired, cannot be lost or diminished in any way
                        3. Most people can read, but a smaller number can really "read"
                        4. However, the inverse is true.  Reading texts especially those packed with information or with a particular style of language requires one to regularly accustom themselves to that kind of writing
                        5. This is important because to let such a skill deteriorate is to allow oneself to be disconnected from an entire medium of communication and information, and a very widespread one at that.
                        6. For example, academic papers, journals, literature, and even news articles are available only in print.
                        7. This may be potentially dangerous because then we are unable to look for alternative information or 
                            digest different perspectives on the same issue or subject because those things may be common in written form only.
                        8. Another importance of keeping this skill alive is because at any point in our lives, 
                            possibly due to our studies or career, we are expected to be able to communicate effectively in written form. 
                            If you do not have much experience with reading, you will not be exposed to different kinds of writing. 
                            You will not know which styles work best for which topics, and you will not build up that intuition on which 
                            words and tone to use while writing. Consequently, it will be difficult for you to produce written works.
                    2. Books require your attention
                        1. Books require a non-zero effort for you to engage with it, in contrast to videos or lecture where 
                            you can let the words just wash over you and remain passive.
                        2. It is often easy for people to watch a 2 hour long lecture on YouTube and feel somewhat accomplished or 
                            feeling like they understand it well after the video ends, all the while not being engaged with the 
                            content at any substantial level.
                        3. On the other hand, books require you to be engaged at all times, lest you 
                    3. Finishing books gives you a sense of accomplishment
                        1. Important for self esteem and making you stick to goals
