                    <h2>A Monumental Achievement in Mathematics</h2>
                    <h4>Review of Fermat's Last Theorem</h4>
                    <p>Simon Singh brings us on a journey through time detailing the toils of generations of mathematicians
                        who dared to take on the infamous Fermat's Last Theorem. In doing so, Singh introduces readers
                        to the various otherworldly branches of mathematics that found their way into the centuries-long fight
                        against the Last Theorem, from abstract algebra and set theory to modular forms and elliptic curves.
                        At the heart of the story is Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles, who set upon the impossible task
                        of proving the theorem ever since he laid eyes on it as a child. What started as a childhood obsession
                        turned into a life's calling for Wiles, who spent nearly a decade in isolation working on the problem.
                        The book culminates in Wiles' presentation of his first proof, its initial failure,
                        and the ecstatic climax of when the proof is repaired and presented to the world.
                    </p> <p class='tab'>
                        The winding path that Wiles and others took in solving it teaches us that the solutions to our problems
                        sometimes hide in plain sight while viewed from different perspectives. Wiles himself would not have thought
                        that Fermat's Last Theorem would be related to elliptic curves, just as much as the vast majority of
                        academics did not think that elliptic curves were related to modular forms.
                    </p> <p class='tab'>
                        Singh's descriptions of the lives and works of the greatest mathematicians of every era are colorful
                        and accessible. Without needing to resort to technical details and difficult equations, he manages to
                        explain the most important works of the likes of Euler, Gauss, and Bertrand Russell and communicate
                        the significance of their ideas.
                    </p> <p class='tab'>
                        I particularly enjoyed the tale of one influential French mathematician named Évariste Galois,
                        who formulated the beginnings of two branches of abstract algebra, namely group theory and his
                        namesake Galois theory, while still a teenager. What made him so fascinating in my eyes
                        was that in addition to being a mathematician, he was a political revolutionary. Galois was a die-hard
                        republican and was one of the Parisian figureheads in the movement against the French monarchy.
