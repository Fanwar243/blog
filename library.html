                <h2>A Monumental Achievement in Mathematics</h2>
                <h4>Review of Fermat's Last Theorem</h4>
                <p>Simon Singh brings us on a journey through time detailing the toils of generations of mathematicians
                    who dared to take on the infamous Fermat's Last Theorem. In doing so, Singh introduces readers
                    to the various otherworldly branches of mathematics that found their way into the centuries-long fight
                    against the Last Theorem, from abstract algebra and set theory to modular forms and elliptic curves.
                    At the heart of the story is Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles, who set upon the impossible task
                    of proving the theorem ever since he laid eyes on it as a child. What started as a childhood obsession
                    turned into a life's calling for Wiles, who spent nearly a decade in isolation working on the problem.
                    The book culminates in Wiles' presentation of his first proof, its initial failure,
                    and the ecstatic climax of when the proof is repaired and presented to the world.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    The winding path that Wiles and others took in solving it teaches us that the solutions to our problems
                    sometimes hide in plain sight while viewed from different perspectives. Wiles himself would not have thought
                    that Fermat's Last Theorem would be related to elliptic curves, just as much as the vast majority of
                    academics did not think that elliptic curves were related to modular forms.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    Singh's descriptions of the lives and works of the greatest mathematicians of every era are colorful
                    and accessible. Without needing to resort to technical details and difficult equations, he manages to
                    explain the most important works of the likes of Euler, Gauss, and Bertrand Russell and communicate
                    the significance of their ideas.
                </p> <p class='tab'>
                    I particularly enjoyed the tale of one influential French mathematician named Évariste Galois,
                    who formulated the beginnings of two branches of abstract algebra, namely group theory and his
                    namesake Galois theory, while still a teenager. What made him so fascinating in my eyes
                    was that in addition to being a mathematician, he was a political revolutionary. Galois was a die-hard
                    republican and was one of the Parisian figureheads in the movement against the French monarchy.
